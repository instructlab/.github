InstructLab is an open source, accessible, and model-agnostic AI project that facilitates contributions to existing large language models (LLMs). Our community's mission is to enable anyone to shape the future of generative AI.

## Get started

* [Install InstructLab locally](https://docs.instructlab.ai/getting-started/mac_metal/)
* [Contribute to the project](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Connect with the community](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/Collaboration.md) to share feedback and ideas, ask questions, and troubleshoot issues.

## Why InstructLab

Many projects are rapidly embracing and extending permissively-licensed AI models, but they face three main challenges:

* Direct contributions to LLMs are not possible. They show up as forks, which are expensive for model creators to maintain, and force consumers to choose a “best-fit” model that isn’t easily extensible.
* The barrier to entry is high. One’s ability to contribute ideas is limited by their AI/ML expertise. One has to learn how to fork, train, and refine models to see their idea move forward.
* There is no direct community governance or best practice around review, curation, and distribution of forked models.

InstructLab solves these problems by using [Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081) [1] (LAB), a new alignment tuning method for LLMs that leverages synthetic data.

InstructLab's model-agnostic technology gives model upstreams the ability to regularly create builds of their open-source-licensed models. This is achieved by composing new skills and knowledge into the model, as opposed to rebuilding and retraining it.

Take a look at LAB-enhanced models on the [InstructLab Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/instructlab).
