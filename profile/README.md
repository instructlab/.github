# Welcome to the üê∂ InstructLab Project

![Banner](https://github.com/instructlab/.github/blob/main/assets/instructlab-banner.png)
InstructLab is a model-agnostic open source AI project that facilitates contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs).

We are on a mission to let anyone shape generative AI by enabling contributed updates to existing LLMs in an accessible way.

**Our community welcomes all those who would like to help us enable ***everyone*** to shape the future of generative AI.**

## Why InstructLab

There are many projects rapidly embracing and extending permissively licensed AI models, but they are faced with three main challenges:

* Contribution to LLMs is not possible directly. They show up as forks, which forces consumers to choose a ‚Äúbest-fit‚Äù model that isn‚Äôt easily extensible. Also, the forks are expensive for model creators to maintain.
* The ability to contribute ideas is limited by a lack of AI/ML expertise. One has to learn how to fork, train, and refine models to see their idea move forward. This is a high barrier to entry.
* There is no direct community governance or best practice around review, curation, and distribution of forked models.

**InstructLab is here to solve these problems.**

The project enables community contributors to add additional "skills" or "knowledge" to a particular model ([read more about these in the `taxonomy` README](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/blob/main/README.md)).

InstructLab's model-agnostic technology gives model upstreams with sufficient infrastructure resources the ability to create regular builds of their open-source licensed models not by rebuilding and retraining the entire model but by composing new skills into it.

Take a look at "lab-enhanced" models on the [InstructLab Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/instructlab) page.

### Read the Paper

InstructLab üê∂ uses a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large Language Models (LLMs.) The "lab" in InstructLab ü•º stands for [**L**arge-Scale **A**lignment for Chat**B**ots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081) [1].
