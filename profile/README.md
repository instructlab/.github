InstructLab is an approachable open source AI community project. Our community's mission is to enable anyone to shape the future of generative AI via the collaborative improvement of open source-licensed Granite large language models (LLMs) using InstructLab's fine-tuning technology.

## Who should use InstructLab?

Have you ever asked an LLM a question about a subject you know well, and it gave an incorrect answer? ‚ÄúIf only I could submit a patch to fix it,‚Äù  you may have thought. With InstructLab, you can!

InstructLab allows anyone to improve an existing LLM by [fine-tuning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lguiHJHgfo) it with additional data sources. This allows LLMs to continuously gain new knowledge, supplementing gaps in their initial training, even about current events that happened since their pre-training phase.

Subject matter experts from any domain‚Äîfor example, [archaeology](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/pull/1269), [astronomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/pull/1159), and [human anatomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy/pull/742)‚Äîcan use InstructLab to teach [the Granite LLM family](https://www.ibm.com/granite) new information.

Project users can experiment with making updates to a quantized version of the Granite model and then rebuild that version locally, checking to see if the update improved the quality of the model‚Äôs responses. InstructLab‚Äô s  tools allow contributors to both see preview of a newly tuned model, and also check to ensure that a submission to improve the community model is properly composed.

You can learn more about InstructLab and how it works in the [project documentation](https://docs.instructlab.ai/).

InstructLab uses [Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081) [1] (LAB), a new alignment tuning method for LLMs that leverages synthetic data.
