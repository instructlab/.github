InstructLab is an approachable open source AI community project. Our community's mission is to enable anyone to shape the future of generative AI via the collaborative improvement of open source licensed Granite large language models (LLMs) using InstructLab's model fine tuning technology.

## Get started

* [Install InstructLab locally](https://docs.instructlab.ai/getting-started/mac_metal/)
* [Contribute to the project](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [Connect with the community](https://github.com/instructlab/community/blob/main/Collaboration.md) to share feedback and ideas, ask questions, and troubleshoot issues.

## Why InstructLab

Many projects are rapidly embracing and extending permissively-licensed AI models, but they face three main challenges:

* Direct contributions to LLMs are not possible. They show up as forks, which are expensive for model creators to maintain, and force consumers to choose a ‚Äúbest-fit‚Äù model that isn‚Äôt easily extensible.
* The barrier to entry is high. One‚Äôs ability to contribute ideas is limited by their AI/ML expertise. One has to learn how to fork, train, and refine models to see their idea move forward.
* There is no direct community governance or best practice around review, curation, and distribution of forked models.

InstructLab solves these problems by using [Large-Scale Alignment for ChatBots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081) [1] (LAB), a new alignment tuning method for LLMs that leverages synthetic data.

InstructLab's model-agnostic technology gives model upstreams the ability to regularly create builds of their open-source-licensed models. This is achieved by composing new skills and knowledge into the model, as opposed to rebuilding and retraining it.

Take a look at LAB-enhanced models on the [InstructLab Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/instructlab).
